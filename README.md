# BMI
A program to calculate a person's BMI

Write a program that calculates and displays a person's Body Mass Index(BMI). The BMI is often used to determine whether a person with a sedentary lifestyle is overweight or underweight for his/her height. A person's BMI is calculated with the following formula:

BMI = Weight * 703 / Height<sup>2</sup>

where weight is measured in pounds and height is meaured in inches. The program should display a message indicating whether a person has optimal weight, is underweight, or is overweight. A sedentary person's weight is considered optimal if his or her BMI is between 18.5 and 25. If the BMI is less than 18.5, the person is considered underweight. If the BMI value is greater than 25, the person is considered overweight.
